# 🎥 Script for LinkedIn Video: 02 - Group By (JavaScript)

## 🚀 Hook (0-15 seconds)
"Group By is one of the most useful exercises in real work. Let me show you how to do it right."

## 📝 Problem (15-45 seconds)
"You have a list of users and need to group them by country. Or a list of numbers and group them by even/odd."

## 🧠 My Mental Approach (45-90 seconds)
"My pattern: validate → determine key function (string or function) → use reduce to build the grouped object. Reduce is perfect because you transform array → object."

## 💻 Code Step by Step (90-240 seconds)
"First I validate the input. Then I create a getKey function that works with string or function. I use reduce because I transform array into object. If the key doesn't exist, I create the array. Then I add the element."

## 💡 Why It's Important (240-270 seconds)
"You use this in dashboards, reports, UI groupings, data analysis. It's a pattern that appears constantly in real work."
