# 10 - Multidimensional Filter

## 📋 Problem Statement

Filter a list of elements by multiple criteria and sort them by different properties.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Filter by multiple conditions (price, category, availability, etc.)
- Sort by different criteria (price asc/desc, name, date, etc.)
- Handle optional filters (if not provided, don't filter)
- Return empty array if invalid input

## 🧠 Mental Pattern to Memorize

1. **Validate input**
2. **Apply filters** in chain (each filter is independent)
3. **Apply sorting** according to criteria
4. **Return** filtered and sorted result
